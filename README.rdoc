Twitter client written with Ruby on Rails, front end in Bootstrap.
Academic project that pins tweets from a twitter account on a map.
The tweets tell historic facts about the city of Reggio Emilia, Italy, pinned in relevant location on a map. By accessing the map from a web browser and allowing geo-localization you will also see a list of pins ordered by proximity.
